### 📖 Project Overview

This project aims to build a **Smart Password-Based Door Lock System** using Arduino that enhances security using a password mechanism. It eliminates the need for physical keys and offers a cost-effective alternative to expensive biometric systems.

> The system allows door access only when the correct password is entered using a 4x4 keypad. A servo motor is used to actuate the lock mechanism. The system is powered by an Arduino UNO which acts as the brain of the setup.

### 🧠 How It Works

1. **Password Setup**: A default password is hardcoded into the Arduino sketch.
2. **User Input**: User enters the password using the keypad.
3. **Password Validation**:

   * ✅ If correct: The servo motor rotates 90° to unlock.
   * ❌ If incorrect: The door remains locked.
4. **Auto-lock**: After a delay or a reset input, the servo returns to its initial (locked) position.

> The password can be changed directly from the Arduino code.

### 🛠 Installation & Setup

1. **Circuit Wiring**:

   * Connect 4x4 keypad to digital pins of Arduino.
   * Connect servo motor to a PWM pin (e.g., D9).
   * Use jumper wires for reliable connections.

2. **Upload Code**:

   * Use the Arduino IDE to upload the code.
   * Ensure the correct COM port and board are selected.

3. **Power On**:

   * Provide power via USB or external battery pack.
